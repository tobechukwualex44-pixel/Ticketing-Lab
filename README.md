<h1> Ticketing Lab </h1> 
 Service Desk Simulation: Shared Drive Access Issue (Permissions Incident)

 ### [YouTube Demonstration](https://youtube.com/@charlesalex5796?si=6UrCsAm_M76EtFSD)

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a ServiceNow-based ticketing lab that simulates a real-world enterprise incident where a user loses access to a shared network drive due to incorrect security group permissions. The lab walks through ticket creation, impact and urgency classification, Active Directory group membership review, permission correction, and access verification. The workflow demonstrates proper help desk triage, escalation logic, and professional ticket documentation within a simulated corporate IT environment.
